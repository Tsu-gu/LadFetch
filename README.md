# LadFetch
Simple and lightweight neofetch alternative (without the ASCII art)

(Ubuntu and Arch aren't displaying correctly as I'm running them through Distrobox, not natively.)
The main point is to deliver a simmilar experience to Neofetch with even more features, and several hundred times smaller file size.
Currently supports Debian, Arch and RedHat based distros. SUSE coming soon. Others will work just fine, except for the package count, but you can modify it easily enough.
# Installation

2. Open your terminal in the same directory
3. Mark the script as executable (right click, allow program to run) and launch it by typing ./LadFetch.sh
